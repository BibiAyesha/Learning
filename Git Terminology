Local Repository : A workng copy of the whole repository in the developers system, where you can edit/remove/modify/create files 
                   and commit to master directory. 
Working Directory : A working Directory is the directory where files are checked out. In Git users modify their files and 
                    add them to the staging area. What Git looks is the file sin the staging area, not all the files that are modified. 
                    Basic Workflow of Git.
                    1. modify the files. 
                    2. add them to the staging area : Git add <file-name>
                    3. Modify whatever you want to modify fromt he staging are and add that to staging area.
                    4. Once the modification is done, add it to the repository. Once you add it to the repo you can't modify them 
                    further as they are immutable. Command for that : git commit –m “Messgae for the commit”
